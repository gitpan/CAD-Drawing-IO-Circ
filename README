NAME
    CAD::Drawing::IO::Circ - load and save for circle data

NOTICE
    This module and the format upon which it relies should be considered
    extremely experimental and should not be used in production except under
    short-term and disposable conditions.

INFO
    This module is intended only as a backend to CAD::Drawing::IO. The only
    method from here which you may want to call directly is pingcirc(),
    which will return information stored in the ".circ_data" file.

    For loading and saving, please use the front-end interface provided by
    load() and save() in CAD::Drawing::IO.

Requisite Plug-in Functions
    See CAD::Drawing::IO for a description of the plug-in architecture.

  check_type

    Returns true if $type is "circ" or $filename is a directory containing a
    ".circ" file.

      $fact = check_type($filename, $type);

  load

      @list = load($drw, $directory, $opts);

  save

      $drw->save();

  pingcirc

    Returns a hash reference for colon-separated key-value pairs in the
    ".circ_data" file which is found inside of $directory. If the file is
    not found, returns undef.

    The key may not contain colons. Colons in values will be preserved
    as-is.

      $drw->pingcirc($directory);

  write_circdata

      $drw->write_circdata($directory, \%options);
